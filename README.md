# Getting Started

This is a web parsing code that specifically designed on hamlet. Not verry efficent because of getFreq() iterates through whole words every time. Fast enough to handle for some part of the book

## Tasks

 1. Reads the text of the game Hamlet by W. Shakespeare from the URL
  http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html 

 2. Parses text into separate words 

 3. Calculates the frequency of each word, ie. counts how many times a word is contained in the text, 

 4. Prints a table of the 20 most common words and their number of occurrences.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (MISSING)

## About Libraries/Packages

I do not own the library files. You need to have Html Unit library to run this code. Please refer to the owner of the library
